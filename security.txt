Can you proceed with development?
Yes, but with guardrails. You have a clear roadmap. The next development work should prioritize integrating the security helpers into existing and new endpoints.
Here is a summary of the current status and immediate actions:
Status	Item	Notes
✅ Mitigated	Auth Bypass (X-User-ID header)	Removed in permissions.py and tenant_helpers.py.
🟡 In Progress	BOLA Protection	Helpers created; now must be implemented in all relevant routes.
🟡 In Progress	Input Validation	Helpers created; now must be implemented in all relevant routes (e.g., using Marshmallow).
⚪ Planned	Encryption at Rest	Planned for the short term roadmap.
⚪ Planned	Compliance (PCI/GDPR)	Planned for the medium term roadmap.
Summary of what's next:
Implement BOLA checks everywhere: The most immediate priority is to use verify_user_owns_resource() or the decorator in every single endpoint that deals with a specific user's resource (/accounts/<id>, /transactions/<id>).
Integrate Input Validation: Replace raw request data handling with your validate_request_data() helper or an established library like Marshmallow.
Start the Roadmap: Begin working on the "Immediate" and "Short term" items in your SECURITY_ROADMAP.md while continuing with feature development.
You have the tools and the plan to build securely from this point forward.
