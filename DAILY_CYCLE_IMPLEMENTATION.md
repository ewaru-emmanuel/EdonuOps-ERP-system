# Daily Cycle Implementation for Finance Module

## Overview

The daily cycle functionality has been successfully implemented to ensure proper daily opening/closing balance management for your finance module. This system captures the state of your inventory and financials at the beginning of each day, tracks all transactions throughout the day, calculates the state at the end of the day, and carries the closing values over as the next day's opening values.

## ‚úÖ What Has Been Implemented

### 1. Database Models
- **DailyBalance**: Stores daily opening and closing balances for all accounts
- **DailyCycleStatus**: Tracks the overall daily cycle status for the system
- **DailyTransactionSummary**: Stores daily transaction summaries for quick reporting

### 2. Backend Services
- **DailyCycleService**: Core service handling opening/closing operations
- **AutomatedDailyProcess**: Automated service for scheduled daily operations
- **API Routes**: RESTful endpoints for daily cycle management

### 3. Frontend Components
- **DailyCycleManager**: Complete UI for managing daily cycles
- **Integration**: Added to FinanceModule with route `/finance?feature=daily-cycle`

### 4. Database Migration
- ‚úÖ Migration completed successfully
- ‚úÖ Tables created: `daily_balances`, `daily_cycle_status`, `daily_transaction_summaries`

## üöÄ How to Use

### Accessing the Daily Cycle Manager

1. Navigate to your finance module: `/finance?feature=daily-cycle`
2. Or use the direct URL: `/finance?feature=daily-cycle`

### Daily Operations

- **When to use**: First thing in the morning or before starting daily operations
- **What it does**:
  - Gets the latest closing balance from the previous day
  - Sets it as today's opening balance
  - Creates daily balance records for all active accounts

#### 2. Calculate Closing Balances
- **Purpose**: Calculates the closing balance for all accounts at the end of the day
- **When to use**: End of day after all transactions are posted
- **What it does**:
  - Calculates daily movements from all transactions
  - Updates closing balances (opening + movements)
  - Generates daily transaction summary

#### 3. Execute Full Cycle
- **Purpose**: Runs both opening capture and closing calculation in sequence
- **When to use**: For complete daily cycle management
- **What it does**:
  - Captures opening balances
  - Calculates closing balances
  - Updates all status indicators

### Automated Operations

#### Command Line Usage
```bash
# Run opening balance capture for today
python backend/services/automated_daily_process.py --action opening

# Run closing balance calculation for today
python backend/services/automated_daily_process.py --action closing

# Run full daily cycle for today
python backend/services/automated_daily_process.py --action full-cycle

# Process all pending cycles
python backend/services/automated_daily_process.py --action pending

# Check system status
python backend/services/automated_daily_process.py --action status

# Run for specific date
python backend/services/automated_daily_process.py --action opening --date 2024-01-15
```

#### Scheduled Automation
You can set up cron jobs or scheduled tasks to run these operations automatically:

```bash
# Daily at 6:00 AM - Capture opening balances
0 6 * * * cd /path/to/your/app && python backend/services/automated_daily_process.py --action opening

# Daily at 11:59 PM - Calculate closing balances
59 23 * * * cd /path/to/your/app && python backend/services/automated_daily_process.py --action closing
```

## üìä API Endpoints

### Daily Cycle Operations

- `POST /api/finance/daily-cycle/calculate-closing` - Calculate closing balances
- `POST /api/finance/daily-cycle/execute-full-cycle` - Execute full cycle

### Status and Data Retrieval
- `GET /api/finance/daily-cycle/status/{date}` - Get cycle status for date
- `GET /api/finance/daily-cycle/balances/{date}` - Get daily balances for date

- `GET /api/finance/daily-cycle/pending-cycles` - Get pending cycles
- `GET /api/finance/daily-cycle/latest-status` - Get latest cycle status

### Example API Usage
```javascript
// Capture opening balances
const response = await fetch('/api/finance/daily-cycle/capture-opening', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ cycle_date: '2024-01-15' })
});

const balances = await fetch('/api/finance/daily-cycle/balances/2024-01-15');
```

## üîÑ Daily Cycle Flow

### 1. Morning Process (Opening)
```
1. System captures opening balances from previous day's closing

3. Sets cycle status to "opening_captured"
4. Ready for daily transactions
```

### 2. Throughout the Day
```
1. All transactions are recorded normally
2. System tracks daily movements in real-time
3. Opening balances remain stable
4. Daily movements accumulate
```

### 3. Evening Process (Closing)
```
1. System calculates total daily movements
2. Updates closing balances (opening + movements)
3. Generates daily transaction summary
4. Sets cycle status to "completed"
5. Ready for next day's opening
```

### 4. Next Day
```
1. Previous day's closing becomes today's opening
2. Cycle repeats automatically

### User Permissions
Ensure users have appropriate permissions to access daily cycle operations.

## üìù Next Steps

1. **Test the System**: Run a few daily cycles manually to verify everything works
2. **Set Up Automation**: Configure scheduled tasks for daily operations
3. **Train Users**: Show your team how to use the daily cycle manager
